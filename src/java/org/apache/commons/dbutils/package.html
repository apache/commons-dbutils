<p>DbUtils is a small set of classes designed to make working with JDBC  easier. JDBC resource cleanup code is mundane, error prone work so these classes abstract out all of the cleanup tasks from your code leaving you with what you really wanted to do with JDBC in the first place: query and update data. </p>
<p>This package contains the core classes and interfaces - DbUtils, QueryRunner and the ResultSetHandler interface should be your first items of interest. </p>
