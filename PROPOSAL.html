<title>Proposal for Commons DBUtils Package</title>
</head>
<body>

<div align="center">
<h1>Proposal for <em>DBUtils</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>
Correct JDBC coding is time consuming and error prone.  Many
JDBC coding tasks can be simplified with a small helper library
that factors out the mundane resource cleanup steps.  DbUtils
is focused on providing such a library without any heavyweight 
framework surrounding it.
</p>


<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>
This proposal is to create a package of Java utility classes for
various types of JDBC related activity.  DbUtils will
not be an OO representation of database objects nor will
it be an Object/Relational framework.  It will be
a lightweight JDBC library that helps developers write
correct database code.
</p>


<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>DBUtils</em> relies only on standard Java 1.2 (or later) APIs for
production deployment.  It utilizes the JUnit testing framework for
developing and executing unit tests, but this is of interest only to
developers of the component. Being dependent on Java 1.2 means that 
this code is expected to be of JDBC 2.0 level. 
</p>

<p>
No external configuration files are utilized.
</p>


<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>
Potential source code for this package will come from the initial 
committers' personal libraries.
</p>

<p>
The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.dbutils</code>.
</p>


<h3>(3)  Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>dbutils</code> in the
    <code>jakarta-commons</code> CVS repository.</li>
<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
    <em>dev@commons.apache.org</em> mailing list.  To help
    list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
    the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
    [dbutils].</li>
<li>Bugzilla - New component "DBUtils" under the "Commons" product
    category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>(4) Initial Committers</h3>

<p>The initial committers on the DBUtils component shall be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Henri Yandell</li>
  <li>Steven Caswell</li>
  <li>Juozas Baliuka</li>
  <li>David Graham</li>
</ul>
